- 👋 Hi, I’m @debaish Hello, my name is Debasish Padhy, and I am a passionate Data Scientist with a strong background in analyzing complex datasets and building machine learning models to drive actionable insights. I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful patterns that enhance business decision-making. With hands-on experience in statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization, I’ve contributed to various data-driven projects, focusing on improving product strategies and optimizing operations.

I’m highly proficient in programming languages such as Python and R, and I have worked with frameworks like TensorFlow and scikit-learn to design and deploy machine learning models. I’ve also collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that increase efficiency and solve real-world business problems.

My goal is to continue leveraging data to address complex challenges and help organizations make informed, data-backed decisions.
